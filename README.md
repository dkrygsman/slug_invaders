# Slug Invaders

## Overview
Slug invaders is a VGA displayed FPGA game coded in Verilog on the Basys development board and Vivado IDE. The game consists of a displayed player which can be controlled, and falling blocks which must be avoided. Points are left behind as the blocks reset and these points can be gathered to increment score. This game was coded from scratch for all components i.e. counters, multiplexers, state machines, etc.
